[![Last succesfull test](https://log.derikon.ro/api/v1/log/read?tag=opencart3&view=svg&label=Opencart&key=ecommerce&background=01afe8)](https://log.derikon.ro/api/v1/log/read?tag=opencart3&view=html)

*The plugin has been tested with most versions of Opencart at every iteration. We recommend using the latest version of Opencart, but if that is not possible for some reason, test the plugin with your OpenCart version and it would probably function properly.*

Last tested version: Opencart 3.0.3.8

## Prerequisites

- The plugin works with vQmod, but also with OCMOD, no need to install vQmod if you don't already need it.

## Installation

Once you have installed OpenCart, follow these simple steps:
1. Signup at [paylike.io](https://paylike.io) (itâ€™s free)
1. Create a live account
1. Create an app key for your OpenCart website
1. Upload the paylike.ocmod.zip file in the extensions uploader.
1. Log in as administrator and click  "Extensions" from the top menu then "extension" then "payments" and install the Paylike plugin by clicking the `Install` link listed there.

## Updating settings

Under the extension settings, you can:
 * Choose the OpenCart store to make settings for
 * Update the payment method text in the payment gateways list
 * Update the payment method description in the payment gateways list
 * Update the title that shows up in the payment popup
 * Add test/live keys
 * Set payment mode (test/live)
 * Change the capture type (Instant/Delayed)
 * Change the order statuses that the orders will get after a certain payment action is done (authorization/capture/refund/void)

 ## How to capture / manage transactions

  The transactions will show up under **`Sales -> Paylike Payments`** side menu. Here you can see capture/refund/void transactions depending on their status. Alternatively Paylike payments can be accessed from SITE_URL/admin/index.php?route=extension/payment/paylike/payments and they can be reached by clicking the green button at the top right of the extension settings page

  In Delayed mode you can do transactions (full capture, refund, void) from admin panel, for each order info page, adding a history to the order. The `Order Status` that is wanted to be set for specific transaction must  be identical with that set in Paylike extension page (Advanced section/tab). By default it is `Completed` for capture, `Refunded` for refund and `Voided` for void an order.

1. Capture
    * In Instant mode, the orders are captured automatically
    * In Delayed mode you can do this in admin panel, order info page, adding **`Completed`** order status history to the order.
    * OR
    * In Delayed mode you can do this in admin panel Paylike Payments in Action section in the table.
2. Refund
    * In Delayed mode you can do this in admin panel, order info page, adding **`Refunded`** order status history to the order.
    * OR
    * To Refund an order you can do this in admin panel Paylike Payments in Action section in the table.
3. Void
    * In Delayed mode you can do this in admin panel, order info page, adding **`Voided`** order status history to the order.
    * OR
    * To Void an order you can do this in admin panel Paylike Payments in Action section in the table.
